                <p>Over the past decade, digital humanists have come a long way in recognizing when
                    a project is <quote rend="inline">done</quote> (<ref target="#kirschenbaum2009"
                        >Kirschenbaum 2009</ref>). But DH still has a problem when it comes to
                    project resiliency. As Constance Crompton points out in her contribution to this
                    issue, DH grant funding is disproportionately awarded to new and shiny digital
                    technologies and tools rather than to disciplinary scholarship implemented and
                    published with standard digital tools. Almost no funding is available for
                    maintenance, remediation, upgrading, and remaking, even though technological
                    frameworks will have changed considerably in a five-year funding cycle. The
                    result is a huge maintenance burden for project leads and developers (Holmes
                    &amp; Takeda in this issue) and/or a hosting and storage problem for
                    institutions (Cummings in this issue). </p>

                <p>Most of the papers in this DHQ special issue are the product of a virtual
                    symposium held in April 2021 by <ref target="https://endings.uvic.ca">The
                        Endings Project</ref> at the University of Victoria. The Endings Project, a
                    five-year collaboration funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research
                    Council (<ref target="http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/">SSHRC</ref>), is creating
                    tools, principles, policies, code, and recommendations for digital scholarship
                    practitioners to create accessible, stable, long-lasting resources in the
                    humanities. Unusually for DH, the Endings Project was initiated by developers
                    (see Holmes &amp; Takeda in this issue). It brings together digital humanists
                    and librarians because, as Matthew Kirschenbaum has argued, <cit><quote
                            rend="inline">Digital humanists need the long-term perspective on data
                            that archivists have</quote>
                        <dhq:citRef><ptr target="#kirschenbaum2013"/></dhq:citRef></cit>. The
                    Endings team’s HCMC developers (all of them humanists by their first training)
                    are the bridge between Humanities researchers and Librarians/archivists,
                    facilitating a long-term conversation between the three constituencies
                    responsible for the intellectual generation, building, and long-term
                    preservation of digital research products. </p>

                <p>The impetus for The Endings Project was the substantial maintenance burden
                    accrued by UVic’s Humanities Computing and Media Centre (<ref target="https://hcmc.uvic.ca/">HCMC</ref>), which has been
                    involved in over 200 digital humanities projects since the 1990s. Its history,
                    as described in Holmes &amp; Takeda, clearly shows the problems inherent in
                    current approaches to digital edition projects, particularly projects with
                    short-term or sporadic grant funding. The growing maintenance burden facing the
                    HCMC was ultimately unsustainable, and Project Endings was conceived and
                    convened to address this problem. </p>
