## Why we need it?

Given the popularity of static web applications, there have been a number of solutions ~~both~~ across industry and the digital humanities for integrating search within a static web application, which can broadly grouped into three categories. While we detail this in Holmes and Takeda 2019b, it is worth ~~quickly~~ summarizing. First, there are the tightly integrated self-hosted server-side approaches, like eXist or Solr, that are highly popular and effective, but are precisely the kinds of technologies that we sought to distance ourselves from via the Endings project. The second are API-driven, cloud-based search engines, like Elastisearch and Algolia. These services maintain the search indexes off-site. Of course, the most popular of these is Google Custom Search Engine (CSE), which Brian Rinaldi, in his guide to Static Site Genertors for O'Reilly, calls  "the undisputed king of search" and the "the best option" for those looking to integrate search into their static sites. Not only are we wary of Google CSE for a suite of non-technical reasons, we are also wary of it due to its severe limitations;  while Google CSE can be tuned (to an extent) for an individual site, our projects—which are often large and complex textual collections—require highly specific filters and facets to facilitate their research. While Algolia and ElastiSearch are far more tunable, they add a significant dependency and require that projects incur additional costs—both monetary and technical. The third are frameworks that, like staticSearch, index the entire document collection during a build process. This third type appear the most promising, but most are ill-equipped for handling large, complex document collections as their indexes are constructed at the document and collection level. 

Of course, there are other ways of creating inverted indexes, but our primary concern in building staticSearch was the ability to integrate the search mechanism into our existing XSLT publishing pipeline. While XML and especially XSLT are less popular than Jekyll, Hugo, and other fashionable static generators, we agree with Kraetke and Imsieske that XSLT is a "modern, powerful static website generator."
