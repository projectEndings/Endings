## Conclusion

While in many cases, staticSearch has been implemented in projects as a replacement for pre-existing search engines, we find ourselves using staticSearch from the start with many our projects. Since staticSearch runs on HTML files, it could be integrated into any publishing workflow that produces well-formed HTML5. We are also continuing to research ways that the static index produced by staticSearch could be packaged with a web archive file (WARC) such that web archives displayed on the Wayback Machine and other web archive viewers would retain their essential search functionality. 

Overall, this paper has outlined our approach behind staticSearch and demonstrates how XSLT can be used to generate a robust search index without the use of server-side technologies.
