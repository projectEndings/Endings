# Background: The Endings Project

The Endings project is a SSHRC-funded collaboration between scholars, programmers and librarians to devise and implement guidelines and practices that ensure the long-term survival and archivability of digital edition projects, not just as data but as functioning web applications. In the first phase of the project, we converted a number of large digital editions with exist-db backends into entirely static sites consisting only of HTML, CSS and JavaScript (Holmes & Takeda 2019a; 2019b; Forthcoming).

Having demonstrated the feasibility of building large sites which are both static and interactive, we were left with one remaining issue: how to provide a search engine for our collections without adding an unwanted technical debt in the form of a server-side backend. We tested a number of approaches, including invoking Google and hooking into a centralized Library-run Solr indexer (Holmes & Takeda 2018), but eventually settled on writing our own entirely client-side JavaScript search engine, staticSearch. Our initial expectations were that this would be practical for smaller sites but perhaps not realistic for our larger sites, which have tens of thousands of documents, but our pessimism has proved unwarranted, and staticSearch is now a core part of over a dozen projects, many of them quite large, and its performance has surprised us.
