### 5.5 Release Management 

Without good release management, then, a project can never end gracefully; it can only falter and die. 

These principles apply to release management:

#### Releases should be periodical and carefully planned. The “rolling release” model should be avoided.

In the world of traditional print scholarship, a publication was a coherent singular object, released on a particular day in a particular place, and provided with a convenient edition number which enabled scholars to cite it without ambiguity.^[This is not strictly true, of course—minor typographical variants are common within a single edition—but for most practical purposes we behave as though it is.] However, many digital edition projects have adopted a "rolling release" approach modelled on the predominant approach to software publication, where corrections and new features are steadily made to a mutable product. As we have argued above, this makes it difficult to maintain consistency, coherence and completeness, and makes citation problematic. Also, since most large projects go through moribund phases in which work largely stops, and will most likely end in a similar way, it is essential that whatever is the current released state (edition) of a project constitutes an acceptable version for the long term.

#### A release should only be made when the entire product set is coherent, consistent and complete (passing all validation and diagnostic tests).



#### Like editions of print works, each release of a web resource should be clearly identified on every page by its build date and some kind of version number.



#### Web resources should include detailed instructions for citation, so that end-users can unambiguously cite a specific page from a specific edition.
