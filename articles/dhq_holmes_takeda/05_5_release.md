### 5.5 Release Management 



<!--Release Management: we now have enough numbered and archived releases for this to be easy to illustrate. Cover citation too; provide easy citation tools that bake in the release version and date.-->



Without good release management, a project can never end gracefully; it can only falter and die. These principles apply to release management:

#### Releases should be periodical and carefully planned. The “rolling release” model should be avoided.



#### A release should only be made when the entire product set is coherent, consistent and complete (passing all validation and diagnostic tests).



#### Like editions of print works, each release of a web resource should be clearly identified on every page by its build date and some kind of version number.



#### Web resources should include detailed instructions for citation, so that end-users can unambiguously cite a specific page from a specific edition.
