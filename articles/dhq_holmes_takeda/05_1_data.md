### 5.1 Data



Data is the expression of the source information, knowledge, and expertise of our researchers. The following principles apply to data:

1.1 Data is stored only in formats which conform to open standards and which are amenable to processing (TEI XML, GML, ODF, TXT).

1.2 Data is subject to version control (Subversion, Git).

1.3 Data is continually subject to validation and diagnostic analysis.
