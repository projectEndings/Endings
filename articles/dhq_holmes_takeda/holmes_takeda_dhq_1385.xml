                <p>This article, by two of the technical leads on Project Endings, represents the
                    culmination of all we have learned over the last few years, during which we have

                <head>2. Early Days</head>

                <p>What is now the Humanities Computing and Media Centre (HCMC) at the University of
                    Victoria was once simply the Language Centre, a unit whose role was to maintain
                    language laboratories and computer workstations and to write software
                    applications used for language teaching courses. We had both Macintosh and
                    Windows workstations, and would typically write custom software for either
                    platform but not both, since writing cross-platform software applications was
                    quite difficult in the days before the World Wide Web (WWW) and Java. When the
                    Web first appeared, we seized on it enthusiastically as a practical way to
                    provide language-teaching resources which could be delivered not only on both
                    kinds of workstation in our labs but also to other locations. When JavaScript
                    emerged around 1996, we were blessed with the capability to create truly
                    interactive programmed teaching exercises, and by the turn of the millenium we
                    had built language-teaching exercise collections for many languages, as well as
                    desktop authoring tools to make the creation of such pages easy for non-coders
                        (<ref target="#arneilHolmes1998">Arneil and Holmes 1998</ref>, <ref
                        target="#arneilHolmes1999">1999</ref>, and <ref target="#arneilHolmes2001"
                        >2001</ref>).</p>

                <p>The materials we created during this period still exist, and they still work
                    perfectly. Examples can be seen in the Indonesian course materials created in
                    1999 (<ptr target="https://web.uvic.ca/hrd/indonesian/"/>) and the
                    endearingly-dated <title rend="quotes">Web Language</title> online presentation
                        (<ptr target="#holmes1997"/>), originally created in 1997 and last updated
                    in 1999. The latter includes a feedback form which is still regularly used, so
                    it still clearly has some relevance despite its appearance. The HTML and
                    JavaScript is still fully functional, although non-standards-based cutting-edge
                    technologies of the time, such as RealAudio, no longer work of course.</p>

                </figure>

                <p>In the early 2000s, the Language Centre was transformed into the Humanities
                    Computing and Media Centre, and given a wider mandate to support what was then
                    commonly termed Humanities Computing, now Digital Humanities. Better-funded
                    projects came along, and more ambitious coding was undertaken, supporting not
                    only language-teaching resources but also digital edition projects, historical
                    datasets, mapping initiatives, and many other research and teaching activities.
                    In particular, we developed some expertise in TEI and the XML-related languages,
                    and began to create large online document collections such as the <title
                        rend="italic">Colonial Despatches</title> project (<ptr
                        target="https://bcgenesis.uvic.ca/"/>) and <title rend="italic">Le Mariage
                        sous l’Ancien Régime</title> (<ptr target="https://mariage.uvic.ca/"/>). In
                    place of static (albeit interactive) web pages, we started to build more
                    sophisticated web applications based on PHP/MySQL database stacks and the eXist
                    XML database.<note><ptr
                            target="https://www.exist-db.org/exist/apps/homepage/index.html"
                        />.</note> Now blessed with our own server infrastructure thanks to the
                    ground-breaking Canadian TaPOR (Text-Analysis Portal) initiative, we were able
                    to run Tomcat, Cocoon, Postgresql, and a host of other backends to support the
                    growing variety of DH projects under way at our institution.</p>

                <p>These server-side systems enabled us (along with the rest of the DH community) to
                    build resources which were more coherent and easier to maintain; information
                    about a single entity, individual, or place could be encoded or stored in a
                    single record, but retrieved and displayed in a multitude of contexts wherever
                    it was needed. Documents could be transcribed and encoded once, but decorated
                    and rendered in many different ways based on the needs of the user or the
                    application context. Sophisticated searching, grouping, and presentation options
                    were easy to implement. Beginning in 2003 we generated a large number of these
                    projects; our servers were well-populated and their CPUs were busy running
                    XQuery, XSLT, PHP, SQL, and even ASP code.</p>

                <p>As Lou Burnard (<ref target="#burnard2016">2016</ref>) remarks, <quote
                        rend="inline" src="#burnard2016">nothing in digital form is ever really
                        finished.</quote> DH projects may languish untended and unloved for periods
                    of time, but their progenitors typically intend to continue working on them
                    periodically or when funding allows. Setting up such projects implies a
                    commitment to maintaining them, and as our project portfolio burgeoned, so did
                    our maintenance burden. As we moved into the 2010s and onwards, a clear pattern
                    began to emerge: projects created in the 1990s continued to work as intended
                    with virtually no maintenance at all, but the projects we had built on
                    sophisticated backend systems such as MySQL and eXist required frequent and
                    time-consuming maintenance work. As an example, the <title rend="italic">Robert
                        Graves Diary</title> (<ptr target="https://graves.uvic.ca/"/>), one of our
                    earliest digital edition projects, was originally written based on eXist version
                    0.9 in 2003–2004; it had to be steadily revised throughout 2005–2007, and then
                    completely rewritten for eXist 1.4 in 2012, because the original
                    Tomcat/Cocoon/eXist 0.9 stack became obsolete. Then in 2014 it had to be updated
                    again. This was a project on which the core academic work had been completed in
                    the first phase of the project, but due to infrastructure churn it regularly
                    returned to haunt us. Over the years, we amassed a maintenance burden which
                    threatened to overwhelm our ability to support new projects coming through our
                    doors.</p>

                <p>This problem was the impetus for Project Endings. The Web had solved for us the
                    challenge to <quote rend="inline"

                    with a selection of active, complex digital edition projects, to determine how
                    we could best plan, execute, and archive our projects in such a way that they
                    would live on indefinitely without further maintenance.</p>

                <head>3. A Catalogue of Failures</head>

                <p>In the early days of the Endings project, we began to examine in detail how our
                    older digital editions and sites had progressively broken down. Some problems
                    were obvious: obsolete versions of server-side applications and services
                    (MapServer, MySQL, PHP) had been retired or replaced, and old code would not run
                    on new versions, even if new versions existed. Other failures were more subtle.
                    We investigated, for example, how successfully our applications had been
                    archived by The Internet Archive (<ptr target="https://archive.org/"/>) and
                    reproduced on the Wayback Machine (<ptr target="https://archive.org/web/"/>). It
                    was immediately obvious that sites built on backend databases, where
                        <q>pages</q> were in fact queries to the database, were very problematic.
                    The project <title rend="italic">Le Mariage sous l’Ancien Régime</title>, which
                    linked to its anthology documents using URLs that queried the server (e.g.
                        <code>http://mariage.uvic.ca/xhtml.xq?id=le_bourgeoise_desprit</code>), was
                    scarcely archived at all, presumably because the archive crawler was unable to
                    follow or parse the query-based links successfully, so for the most part, the
                    archived versions of the site consist mainly of notices that <quote
                        rend="inline">The Wayback Machine has not archived that URL.</quote></p>

                <figure>
                    <graphic url="images/figure02.png" style="width: ; height: ;"/>
                    <figDesc>An error page from the Wayback Machine, which has failed to archive a
                        web page whose content is retrieved using a query string.</figDesc>
                    <head>Wayback Machine error page</head>
                </figure>

                <p><title rend="italic">Mariage</title> also had a rather gratuitous feature whereby
                    the end user could choose between three available colour schemes, and because
                    that functionality relied entirely on JavaScript, the required CSS files had
                    been retrieved and stored as though they were HTML pages, and no styling
                    appeared on the site pages at all. Site search engines failed completely, as did
                    any annotation popups linked from texts which relied on retrieving data by
                    querying the backend database, and JavaScript-based interactivity was generally
                    broken. In fact, the majority of our large-scale, high-profile digital edition
                    projects were scarcely functional at all in the Wayback Machine, and most of
                    their content had not even been retrieved and stored.</p>

                <p>The Internet Archive had never been one of our primary backup strategies, but it
                    was disappointing to discover how unsuccessful it had been in its attempts to
                    crawl and reproduce our sites. Although some of these failures could perhaps be
                    laid at the door of the Internet Archive crawler, Heritrix, which had some
                    limitations, most of them were clearly our fault, and resulted from our crude
                    approach to URL construction. One site, the <title rend="italic">Robert Graves
                        Diary</title>, was represented by only a handful of static pages, since the
                    majority of its content was designed to be accessed through explicit searches
                    from the home page, with the search parameters encoded in URL query strings; the
                    crawler would have had no way to know what pages existed on the site other than
                    the few information and background pages linked directly from the home page. On
                    the live versions of these sites, any pages accessed by a user were typically
                    constructed on the fly by XQuery and XSLT, so they did not exist in any form
                    which could be backed up even locally by any normal method.</p>

                <p>Digging deeper into methods for backing up and replicating our projects within
                    our own institution revealed other problems. Some sites and applications
                    included hard-coded links to local resources using absolute URLs rather than
                    relative ones, so if the site were replicated in a different location, it would
                    still be dependent on, and prone to send the user over to, the original
                    site.</p>

                <p>Another problem faced by projects backed by online databases was a lack of
                    consistency in versioning of content. Typically, multiple project members had
                    rights to upload new material directly into the live database, thus
                        <q>publishing</q> it, but there was no attempt to ensure that the current
                    state of the live site was — in Endings parlance — coherent, consistent, and
                    complete (see <ptr target="#holmesTakeda2019b"/>). Someone editing a primary
                    source text might upload a new chapter to the site, forgetting that it contained
                    links to newly-added people in the personography or locations in the
                    placeography which also needed to be uploaded, so those links would fail. Every
                        <q>page</q> might have a different publication date, and the site overall
                    had no version or edition information, so anyone citing it would be forced to
                    fall back on the rather unfortunate <q>last accessed</q> date to anchor their
                    citation, knowing that the specific version of the document they were citing
                    might change tomorrow with no warning and no way to retrieve the previous
                    version. This was a problem of project organization rather than a technical
                    issue, and it arose largely out of the working methods emerging in the early
                    2000s. In the excitement provoked by the new affordances and publication
                    possibilities inherent in digital projects, there was a tendency to publish
                    anything and everything as quickly as possible. A measured and thoughtful
                    approach to <q>rolling publication</q> is of course possible, but, as we discuss
                    in section 5.5, our work on Endings has convinced us that for most projects, a
                    more traditional edition-based methodology is better.</p>
                
                <p>Finally, we were forced to acknowledge that few of our projects had adequate documentation, making remediation and reconstruction doubly difficult.</p>
                
                <p>We had, it seemed, spent a dozen years enthusiastically generating fragile, unmanageable, unmaintainable, unarchivable contraptions, and we were going to pay the price for our thoughtlessness.</p>
                
                <p>This is not an unusual situation. In fact, our research suggests that it is the norm for DH projects.<note>In our Endings survey, for example, 31% of projects used a MySQL database, 15% used Drupal, and 18% used WordPress; others depended on Ruby/Rails, Django, Omeka, Plone, Cocoon, and eXist.</note> Many DH web applications are built rapidly, using off-the-shelf frameworks and libraries which date quickly and are ultimately guaranteed to fail, and most projects either rebuild their applications in repeated cycles of funding, or see them languish and ultimately disappear. Our situation was perhaps more pointed and critical because we are a base-funded unit with a long lifetime, committed to maintaining our projects even after their initial funding is exhausted. Units like ours are still relatively rare; in most cases, there is little or no institutional help and no expectation of any. But having caused the problem, we now had to fix it, not just by rebuilding multiple large projects, but by doing so in such a way that we would not have to do the same work again in another ten years.</p>
