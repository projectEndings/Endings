## 8. Conclusion
 
When Project Endings began, we really had no idea how practical it would be to build complex digital editions without back-end services, but our initial work was very encouraging, and in fact it proved relatively straightforward to rewrite even very large and complex sites such as _The Colonial Despatches_ (over 7,000 TEI-encoded documents) and _The Map of Early Modern London_ (over 12,000 pages) into simple, fast, responsive and easily searchable static sites. Other sites from our growing collection have taught us to handle a variety of different types of data such as video (_Francotoile_) and image collections (_MyNDIR_), while the largest dataset, the _Landscapes of Injustice Archive_, presents a searchable collection of over 150,000 pages representing diverse data including maps, oral histories, land title records, street directories (in Japanese and English), correspondence, and legal casefiles.

At this point, we can say with confidence that the approach we have taken is practical and effective. You _can_ build digital editions this way, and it really doesn't take much more work than rolling out a Tamagotchi of frameworks, libraries, software and infrastructure. Once it's done, it takes no maintenance at all, and you're free to move on to the next project or focus on the next edition.

We're doing it. You should do it too. You'll regret it if you don't.
