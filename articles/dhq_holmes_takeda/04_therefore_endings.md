## 4. The Endings Project

The Endings Project was set up as a formal collaboration between the HCMC programmers grappling with the issue of project obsolescence, a group of four Principal Investigators leading some of our largest and longest-running active projects, and a group from the University Library. We began with the aim of researching, formalizing and testing a range of strategies for rewriting four projects, _The Map of Early Modern London_, _Le Mariage sous L'Ancien Régime_, the _Nxaʔamxcín Dictionary Database_, and _The Robert Graves Diary_, with longevity in mind. Funding for the project, formally titled _Endings: Concluding, Archiving, and Preserving Digital Projects for Long-Term Usability_, was provided by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, for four years starting in April 2016. Since then, we have added many more projects, some new and some dating back many years, to the project portfolio, and there are now 14 projects under the Endings umbrella. Each individual project has provided its own unique set of challenges and resulted in fresh ideas and strategies as we have learned to build static sites from them.

The Endings project has produced a range of outputs, including a survey with follow-up interviews, software, many articles and presentations, many static-site digital editions, and the 2021 symposium from which this special issue was born. But perhaps the most important outcome of our work has been a set of principles which attempts to codify our approach to site-building.
