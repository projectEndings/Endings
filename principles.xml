           <p>We divide digital projects into five primary components: data, products, processing,
              documentation, and release management.</p>
           <list rend="numbered">
              <item>DATA <p>Data is the expression of the source information, knowledge, and expertise
                 of our researchers. The following principles apply to data:</p>

                    <item>Data is the expression of the source information, knowledge, and expertise
                       of our researchers. The following principles apply to data:</item>
                    
                    <item>Data is stored only in formats which conform to open standards and which are
                       amenable to processing (TEI XML, GML, ODF, TXT).</item>
                    
                    <item>Data is subject to version control (Subversion, Git).</item>
                    
                    <item>Data is continually subject to validation and diagnostic analysis.</item>
                 </list>
              </item>
              <item>PRODUCTS <list rend="numbered">
                 <item>Products are the project output intended for end-users, typically in the
                    form of websites or print documents. The following principles apply to
                    products intended for the web:</item>
                 <item>No dependence on server-side software: build a static website with no
                    databases, no PHP, no Python.</item>
                 <item>No boutique or fashionable technologies: use only standards with support
                    across all platforms, whose long-term viability is assured. Our choices are
                    HTML5, JavaScript and CSS.</item>
                 <item>No dependence on external libraries: no JQuery, no AngularJS, no
                    Bootstrap.</item>
                 <item>No query strings: every entity in the site has a unique page with a simple
                    URL.</item>
                 <item>Graceful failure: every page should still basically work even in the absence
                    of JavaScript or CSS support.</item>
                 <item>Massive redundancy: every page contains all the components it needs, so that
                    it will function without the rest of the site if necessary, even though this
                    means duplicating information across the site.</item>
                 <item>Relentless validation: every site build involves validation of all input
                    data (XML) and all output code (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS). </item>
                 <item>Inclusion of data: every site should include a documented copy of the source
                    data, so that users of the site can repurpose the work easily.</item>
                 <item>These principles are tempered by the following concessions:</item>
                 <item>Once a fully-working static site is achieved, it may be enhanced by the use
                    of other services such as a server-side indexing tool (Solr, eXist) to
                    support searching and similar functionality.</item>
                 <item>The use of an external library may be necessary to support a specific
                    function which is too complex to be coded locally (such as mapping
                    or cryptography). Any such libraries must be open-source and widely-used,
                    and must not themselves have dependencies.</item>
              </list>
              </item>
              <item>PROCESSING <list rend="numbered">
                 <item>Processing code is written and maintained by the project technical staff,
                    and is also subject to version control. Processing code provides all the
                    following functions:</item>
                 <item>Validation of data.</item>
                 <item>Diagnostics (analysis of data to identify issues, and to track and evaluate
                    progress).</item>
                 <item>Generation of products.</item>
                 <item>Validation of products.</item>
                 <item>For larger projects, these processes should all be triggered automatically
                    by any change to version-controlled resources, typically running on a
                    continuous integration server. Processing code should be open-source where
                    possible, and have minimal dependencies, but it is not expected to have
                    significant longevity; data and products are designed to survive, but
                    processing code is contingent.</item>
              </list>
              </item>
              <item>DOCUMENTATION <list rend="numbered">
                 <item>Data models, including field names, descriptions, and controlled values,
                    should be clearly documented in a static document that is maintained with
                    the data, and should also form part of the products. </item>
                 <item>All rights and intellectual property issues should be clearly documented.
                    Where possible the Data and Products should be released under open licenses
                    (Creative Commons, GNU, BSD, MPL).</item>
              </list>
              </item>
              <item>RELEASE MANAGEMENT <list rend="numbered">
                 <item>Release management handles the public release of products. Without good
                    release management, a project can never end gracefully; it can only falter
                    and die. These principles apply to release management:</item>
                 <item>Releases should be periodical and carefully planned. The "rolling release"
                    model should be avoided.</item>
                 <item>A release should only be made when the entire product set is coherent,
                    consistent and complete (passing all validation and diagnostic tests).</item>
                 <item>Like editions of print works, each release of a web resource should be
                    clearly identified on every page by its build date and some kind of version
                    number.</item>
                 <item>Web resources should include detailed instructions for citation, so that
                    end-users can unambiguously cite a specific page from a specific
                    edition.</item>
              </list>
              </item>
