    <h3>Building Sustainable Digital Humanities Projects</h3>
    <main>
        <!-- I don't believe we need this intro stuff any more. -->
        <!-- 
            <p>Whereas the codex has proven its reliability over centuries, the digital documents
                  in increasingly wide use today are evanescent and fragile. The digital humanities
                  are facing an urgent problem: experts warn of a new “digital dark age” as our ability
                  to produce digital content continues to outpace our capacity to preserve and access
                  on-line resources for the long term. Awareness of the challenge of preserving and
                  future-proofing these digital projects—many based on boutique technologies and customized
                  code—is growing across the DH landscape, but to date more literature has been devoted
                  to identifying the problem than to solving it.</p> 
               <p>In April 2016, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada funded
                  for four years <em>Endings: Concluding, Archiving, and Preserving Digital Projects for Long-Term Usability</em>, a project exploring practical answers to the questions of how and where DH projects
                  should be archived in order maintain the dynamic features that make them readable,
                  searchable, and even interactive. Our research is based on four case studies, each
                  one a Digital Humanities project born from print sources.</p> 
               <p>The deep enrichment afforded to print by digital tools must not be lost in the face
                  of poor (or no) viable preservation strategies. Our goal is to afford the same sort
                  of stability to DH work that print has provided for so long.</p> 
                  -->
        <p>The Endings project began with a portfolio of four long-running University of Victoria
            projects as test cases for developing our guidelines, principles and approaches for
            achieving sustainability:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://graves.uvic.ca">The Robert Graves Diary</a></li>

            <li><a href="https://mariage.uvic.ca/">Le Mariage sous l’Ancien Régime</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://mapoflondon.uvic.ca">The Map of Early Modern London</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>These original projects are described below. As the Endings work has proceeded, other digital
            projects have been <q>adopted</q> as Endings exemplars:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://majw.uvic.ca/">Medieval Anglo-Jewish Women</a></li>

                (site not yet public)</li>
            
        </ul>
        <p>Most of these projects are still very much in their prime, and one or two of them are
            only just getting started. In fact, it is much easier to design a project from scratch
            with longevity in mind than it is to rescue or re-work an old project which has been
            active for a long time. One additional project, the <i>Scandinavian Canadian Studies
                Journal</i>, was originally an Endings site, but due to a change of editorship it is
            now hosted elsewhere and is no longer Endings-compliant.</p>

        <h3 id="le-mariage-sous-lancien-régime-marriage-in-early-modern-france">Le Mariage sous
            l’Ancien Régime (Marriage in Early Modern France)</h3>
        <p>During the Early Modern era (16<sup>th</sup>-18<sup>th</sup> centuries) Western society
            was obsessed by marriage, an institution evolving rapidly as the Catholic Church faced
            revolt from protestants and governments sought to legislate in areas previously left
            under religious authority. From the formal beginning of the Counter-Reformation with the
            Council of Trent in 1545 until the end of Louis XIV’s reign in 1715, attempts in France
            to renew the institution of marriage inspired debate resulting in the production of new
            sorts of texts and images alongside the rebirth of certain traditional forms of
            critique. The documents in this anthology are the fruit of the conflict among competing
            discourses: what we call the “nuptial imaginary” is composed of diverse textual genres,
            each with its own characteristics, but all concerned with the fears, desires, and
            phantasms that were increasingly visible in an Early Modern society reacting to new
            social, political, and religious configurations.</p>
        <p>Between the 1570s and 1630s, the misogynist and misogamist satire so common in the Middle
            Ages experienced renewed vigour, playing with traditional historical and mythological
            allusions while also using pseudo-scientific glosses on medical discourse and
            Renaissance travel literature. As this “new polemics” disappeared from published texts
            in the 1640s, satire directed at shrews and their hen-pecked husbands found purchase in
            popular images: the anthology contains over 70 engravings on the theme of unhappy
            marriage.</p>
        <p>The mid century provides a more hopeful view. Already at the end of the 16<sup>th</sup>
            century there had been backlash against the new marriage satire, and by the 1650s, salon
            literature painted a more nuanced picture of both the perils and the pleasures of
            married life. Another textual genre born in the 1630s out of the marriage debates is the
            Catholic marriage manual destined to guide couples through the pitfalls of married life.
            The anthology includes three examples illustrating the movement away from “consoling”
            couples in the 1660s to increasing severity from the Church as the century progressed:
            more egalitarian relations between wife and husband were seen as dangerously undermining
            traditional social structures.</p>
        <p>Significantly, in non-religious discourse during the last third of the century, ridicule
            predominates, both of dysfunctional couples and of the institution itself, putting in
            doubt attempts by the Church and the monarchy to reaffirm the importance of marriage as
            an essential social building block. This questioning posture can be seen most clearly in
            fiction; among the several novels included in the anthology, <em>Les Agreemens et les
                chagrins du mariage</em> stands out for its biting denunciation.</p>
        <p>From over a century of critique, a more profound renewal of the institution became
            possible in 18<sup>th-</sup>century France: the middle-class ideal of couples as
            helpmeets, anchored in early protestant discourse, gradually took on new purchase in
            pre-Revolutionary times. If resources become available, this anthology can include
            documents illustrating this evolution.</p>
        <p>The goal of this project is not only to develop the corpus described above, but also to
            contribute to the exploration of the potential of the digital scholarly edition, as
            illustrated in the critical apparatus: notes, bibliography, commentary and textual
            analysis, and especially the proper-name index containing hundreds of entries.</p>
        <p>The rights to reproduce the engravings were purchased from the Bibliothèque Nationale de
            France thanks to funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of
            Canada. Other elements of the site (contributions from the editors, transcription of

        <h3 id="Nxaʔamxčín-database-and-dictionary">Nxaʔamxčín Database and Dictionary</h3>
        <p>This is a database of words and phrases from the Nxaʔamxčín language (sometimes referred
            to in English as Moses, or Moses-Columbia Salish). The purpose of this database is to
            pull together all the materials on Nxaʔamxčín compiled by M. Dale Kinkade and Ewa
            Ezaykowska-Higgins, two linguists who worked closely with native speakers of the
            language. The goals of the project are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>to make these materials available and easily accessible to the Nxaʔamxčín community,
                rather than to leave them stored on file cards and in notebooks;</li>
            <li>to serve as a searchable tool for learners, teachers, speakers, and linguists;</li>
            <li>to serve as a source for Nxaʔamxčín vocabulary and phrases;</li>
            <li>to serve as a source for creating a Nxaʔamxčín Dictionary in print format.</li>
            <li>to serve as a model for the role of digitization in language preservation and
                revitalization.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="robert-graves-diary">Robert Graves Diary</h3>
        <p>The University of Victoria digital edition of the Robert Graves Diary has long been seen as a
            pioneering XML publication project. Beginning with a pilot markup project in 2001 (still
            used as an example for training purposes by the TEI), it evolved into a complete edition
            of the diaries of Robert Graves from the period 1935 to 1939 and was one of the first
            projects built on the now widely used eXist XML database system. A collaboration between
            the University of Victoria’s English department, the HCMC, and UVic Libraries (whose
            Special Collections holds the original manuscript), it has been widely cited and
            referenced as a model project in the field of Digital Humanities since its first
            publication in 2004. The database was shared successfully with Trinity College
            Dublin. The site has been rewritten to be Endings-compliant, and was the first of
            our Endings sites to be transitioned to long-term archive hosting at the University
            of Victoria Library.
