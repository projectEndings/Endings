        <p><strong>How do and how should DH projects conclude?</strong></p> 
        <p>The Endings Project is a five-year project funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities
            Research Council (<a href="http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/">SSHRC</a>) that is creating tools, principles, policies and recommendations for digital scholarship
            practitioners to create accessible, stable, long-lasting resources in the humanities.</p> 
        <p>Some of the questions we are attempting to answer include “how should we preserve
            projects to retain their dynamic features” &amp; “where should projects be archived?”
