    <h2>Building Sustainable Digital Humanities Projects</h2>
    <main>
        <p>Despite the thousands of digital projects launched during the past 20 years, <a
                href="http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-31450389">experts warn of a new
                    <q>digital dark age</q></a> as our ability to produce digital information
            continues to outpace our capacity to preserve and access that knowledge for the long
            haul.</p>
        <p>These challenges extend across many domains, but they are particularly pressing for
            digital humanities (DH) projects. The challenge of preserving and future-proofing these
            projects—many based on boutique technologies and customized code—jeopardizes their
            future. To continue to reap the benefits of these projects, we must invest in workable
            processes and technologies so we can collect, preserve and provide user-friendly access
            for longer than the estimated 10-year lifespan of most current formats.</p>
        <p>While a growing body of research on the closure and preservation of digital projects
            identifies the urgency and scale of these challenges, few practical solutions have been
            offered.</p>
        <p>The University of Victoria’s extensive experience with a broad variety of SSHRC and
            CFI-funded DH projects over the past 15 years gives our team a unique perspective to
            consider these questions. Each of our funded DH projects has well-developed scholarly
            content useful to the scholarly community for the foreseeable future, and each poses
            different, representative problems for sustained digital conservation and usability.</p>
        <p>Our multidisciplinary team, including <a href="people.html">research faculty</a> from
            several disciplines, <a href="people.html">programmers</a>, and <a href="people.html"
                >digital librarians</a>, has collective theoretical and practical experience in
            geohumanities, multimedia markup, endangered language documentation, textual editing,
            digital publishing, and text encoding.</p>
        <p>Using case studies that address the following research questions, we have developed
            practical strategies for concluding and preserving scholarly digital projects, and for
            maintaining long-term usability across a representative range of disciplines and DH
            methodologies.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>How do and how should DH projects conclude</strong>? The dynamic nature of
                digital data lends itself to new and promising possibilities, and the protean
                digital environment makes publication a moving target. Despite these temptations,
                while our research and scholarship go on, projects—even digital ones—need to end. We
                have investigated strategies and landmarks to bring DH projects to closure.</li>
            <li><strong>How should we preserve projects to retain their dynamic features?</strong>
                By extrapolating from existing theoretical models and experimenting with our own
                projects, we have developed programming strategies to maintain site usability
                and functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Where should projects be archived?</strong> While university libraries are
                reliable repositories for static digital material, we need multiple repositories
                that can preserve the dynamic features of projects. However, such distributed
                archiving will also magnify the technological, economic, and political challenges of
                preservation including intellectual property concerns along with maintenance
                strategies, long-term stability, and access issues.</li>
