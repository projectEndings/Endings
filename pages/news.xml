                <div class="post-entry">
                    <p>We have just published three entirely static sites:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://mapoflondon.uvic.ca">The Map of Early Modern

                        <li><a href="https://johnkeats.uvic.ca">Mapping Keats's Progress</a>,
                            edition 3.0. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>and we're about to publish a fourth, Trish Baer's MyNDIR.</p>
                    <p>All four of these are using recent versions of the Endings <a
                            href="https://github.com/projectEndings/staticSearch">staticSearch
                            tool</a>, which now includes support for wildcard searches as well as
                        booleans and a variety of different search filters. Check it out at the <a
                            href="https://bcgenesis.uvic.ca/search.html">Despatches site</a>. </p>
                    <p>This is a significant point in our work. Not only have we developed a set of
                        rigorous principles for digital longevity; we have also applied them with
                        complete success to a substantial number of projects. We have solved the
                        search-dependency problem far more effectively than we expected to be able
                        to; when we started Endings, we had no idea how to tackle it, and now we
                        have search pages which are better, faster, more configurable and more
                        elegant than what the old databases used to afford us. We have been able to
                        take down two XML database applications, and when MyNDIR is published we'll
                        be able to remove a third and shut down an entire Tomcat instance. </p>
                    <p>We're also able to demonstrate that multiple editions can live side-by-side,
                        just like books on a shelf; <a href="https://mapoflondon.uvic.ca/old/6.3/"
                            >MoEML</a> 6.3 is still available, as is <a
                            href="https://bcgenesis.uvic.ca/old/2.0/">Despatches 2.0</a>. There's no
                        reason why we shouldn't keep them, and every subsequent edition, for ever if
                        we want to and we can afford the disk space. At any point, the Library can
                        take any or all of these editions and serve them itself without any server
                        requirements other than any old web server. </p>
