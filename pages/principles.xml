    <h2>Endings Principles for Digital Longevity<br/>
        Version 2.2.1, 2023-03-03</h2>
    <main>
        <p>We divide digital projects into five primary components:</p> 
        <ol> 
            <li><a href="principles.html#data">Data</a></li> 
            <li><a href="principles.html#documentation">Documentation</a></li> 
            <li><a href="principles.html#processing">Processing</a></li> 
            <li><a href="principles.html#products">Products</a></li> 
            <li><a href="principles.html#release-management">Release management</a></li> </ol> 
        <h3 id="data">1 Data</h3> 
        <p>Data is the expression of the source information, knowledge, and expertise of our
            researchers. The following principles apply to data:
        </p> 
        <p>1.1 Data is stored only in formats that conform to open standards and that are amenable
            to processing (TEI XML, GML, ODF, TXT).</p> 
        <p>1.2 Data is subject to version control (Subversion, Git).</p> 
        <p>1.3 Data is continually subject to validation and diagnostic analysis.</p> 
        <h3 id="documentation">2 Documentation</h3> 
        <p>2.1 Data models, including field names, descriptions, and controlled values, should
            be clearly documented in a static document that is maintained with the data and forms
            part of the products.</p> 
        <p>2.2 All rights and intellectual property issues should be clearly documented. Where
            possible the Data and Products should be released under open licenses (Creative Commons,
            GNU, BSD, MPL).</p> 
        <h3 id="processing">3 Processing</h3> 
        <p>Processing code is written and maintained by the project technical staff, and is also
            subject to version control. Processing code provides all the following functions:</p> 
        <p>3.1 Relentless validation: all processing includes validation/linting of all inputs
            and
            outputs and all validation errors should exit the process and prevent further execution
            until the errors are resolved.</p> 
        <p>3.2 Continuous integration: any change to the source data requires an entire rebuild
            of the site (triggered automatically where possible). </p> 
        <p>3.3 Code is contingent: while code is not expected to have significant longevity,
            wherever possible, all code should follow Endings principles for data and products.</p> 
        <h3 id="products">4 Products</h3> 
        <p>Products are the project outputs intended for end-users, typically in the form of
            websites
            or print documents. The following principles apply to products intended for the web:
        </p> 
        <p>4.1 No dependence on server-side software: build a static website with no databases,
            no PHP, no Python.</p> 
        <p>4.2 No boutique or fashionable technologies: use only standards with support across
            all platforms, whose long-term viability is assured. Our choices are HTML5, JavaScript,
            and CSS.</p> 
        <p>4.3 No dependence on external libraries or services: no JQuery, no AngularJS, no Bootstrap,
            no Google Search.</p> 
        <p>4.4 No query strings: every entity in the site has a unique page with a simple URL
            that will function on any domain or IP address.</p> 
        <p>4.5 Inclusion of data: every site should include a documented copy of the source data,
            so that users of the site can repurpose the work easily.</p> 
        <p>4.6 Massive redundancy: every page contains all the components it needs, so that it
            will function without the rest of the site if necessary, even though doing so means
            duplicating
            information across the site.</p> 
        <p>4.7 Graceful failure: every page should still function effectively even in the absence
            of
            JavaScript or CSS support.</p> 
        <p>These principles are tempered by the following concessions:</p> 
        <p>4.8 Once a fully-working static site is achieved, it may be enhanced by the use of
            other services such as a server-side indexing tool (Solr, eXist) to support searching
            and similar functionality.</p> 
        <p>4.9 The use of an external library may be necessary to support a specific function
            that is too complex to be coded locally (such as mapping or cryptography). Any such
            libraries must be open-source and widely-used, and must not themselves have dependencies.</p> 
        <h3 id="release-management">5 Release Management</h3> 
        <p>Release management handles the public release of products. These principles apply
            to release management:</p> 
        <p>5.1 Releases should be periodical and carefully planned. The “rolling release” model
            should be avoided.
        </p> 
        <p>5.2 A release should only be made when the entire product set is coherent, consistent,
            and complete (passing all validation and diagnostic tests).
            
        </p> 
        <p>5.3 Like editions of print works, each release of a web resource should be clearly
            identified on every page by its build date and some kind of version number.
            
        </p> 
        <p>5.4 Web resources should include detailed instructions for citation, so that end-users
            can unambiguously cite a specific page from a specific edition.</p> 
        <p>5.5 URLs for individual resources within a digital publication should persist across
            editions. Any moved, retired, or deleted resources no longer available at a previously
            accessible URL should be redirected appropriately.</p>
