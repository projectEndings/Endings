    <h1>Software</h1>
    <main>
        <p>As part of our work on Endings, Martin Holmes and Joey Takeda have created two
            collections of software which are open-source on GitHub.</p>
        <h3 id="static-search">staticSearch</h3>
        <p>This <a href="https://github.com/projectEndings/staticSearch">codebase</a> provides a
            pure-JSON search engine for your HTML5 website, including boolean and phrasal searches,
            various types of search filter, keyword-in-context results, and bookmarkable search
            results. It uses no back-end code at all, so it complies with Endings principles. Take a
            look at the <a href="https://johnkeats.uvic.ca/search.html">Mapping Keatsâ€™s Progress
                site search</a> for a simple working example, and <a
                href="https://bcgenesis.uvic.ca/search.html">The Colonial Despatches</a> site for a
            more complex one.</p>
        <p>You can see the full documentation for the latest release <a
                href="staticSearch/docs/index.html">here</a>.</p>
        <h3 id="tei-diagnostics">TEI Diagnostics</h3>
        <p>This <a href="https://github.com/projectEndings/diagnostics">codebase</a> is a toolkit
            for checking the coherence, consistency and completeness of your TEI XML project from
            inside the Oxygen XML Editor (although you can also use it at the command line). It
            performs a number of generic checks through the collection, but it is also easily
            extensible to check other features that may be particular to your project.</p>
        <p>A similar <a href="https://github.com/projectEndings/html_diagnostics">toolkit</a> is
            available to check your HTML.</p>
