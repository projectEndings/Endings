# Endings: How to end (and archive) your digital edition
## A course for DHSI 2019

## Advance Preparation

 - If your project has a current website with a public URL, send us that URL. We will run it through the Archive-It tool used by the Internet Archive so that you can see the results when you come to the course.
 - Work your way through our questionnaire [How sustainable is my DH project?](https://hcmc.uvic.ca/endings/questionnaire.htm). Warning: this will probably annoy you, but in a productive way, by forcing you to think about aspects of your project that you may have avoided considering.
 - Take a look at this short list of short readings:
