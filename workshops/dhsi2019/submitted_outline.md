Proposal for DHSI 2018
I. Text for DHSI website

Few digital editions are finished and archived; some are eventually abandoned or neglected, while
others fail and disappear. What do we need to do to ensure that our digital editions, begun with the best intentions
and often with generous funding, produce coherent, consistent, and complete products that can be
deposited in the library? How can we maximize the chances that our digital editions will be
accessible and functional for decades to come? This course is intended for people who are engaged
in a digital edition that is nearing completion, people who worry that their edition will never end,
people who want to deposit their edition in a library or digital archive, and people who are planning
ahead to end and archive an edition. We will ask what it means to end a project, what should remain
“on the shelf” in 20 years, and what happens when we run projects through existing archiving tools.
We address the difference between archivable data and an archivable edition, and the importance of
preserving the latter as well as the former despite the challenges of digital dependencies. We will
create an “Endings-compliant” completion plan that includes diagnostic processes to measure
progress. We will learn practical steps to “staticize” various types of site, ask critical questions about
interface, and discuss best practices for design. The course concludes with a documentation exercise
that will help participants identify the strengths and weaknesses of an edition’s documentation.

The course is taught by a team of humanists, programmers, and librarians who are studying the
challenge of ending digital editions in archivable ways and developing best practices to ensure long-
term durability of digital data and interfaces. Learning methods will include lectures, workshops,
demonstrations, hands-on exercises, hackathons, discussion, and peer feedback. Participants will
leave with a detailed Endings-compliant project plan for a specific project version, with timelines,
requirements (external programmers, etc .), outputs, archiving strategy, and so on. Consider this
offering to build on “Conceptualizing and Creating a Digital Edition,” “ Digital Editing with TEI:
Critical, Documentary and Genetic Editing,” “ Advanced TEI Concepts / TEI Customization,”
Conceptualising and Creating a Digital Documentary Edition,” and/or “Text Encoding
Fundamentals and their Application.”

Note: Please write to the course coordinator (Martin Holmes at mholmes@uvic.ca) in advance with
a list of your project’s technologies/platforms, a note about some of the challenges you have faced
along the way, and the URL for your project.

II. Detailed Course Plan

PREPARATION FOR THE COURSE (TWO WEEKS OUT)
Send the URL of the current incarnation of your site. We’ll run it through Archive-It.
DAY 1. “O, make an end of what I have begun” ... without falling on a sword

Introduction to the course and each other (Martin and Janelle)
What does it mean to end a project? (Martin)
Incremental publication versus numbered editions.
What do you have to do to end your project?
What should remain “on the shelf” in 20 years?
Look at results from Archive-It run-through (Matt)
Look at case studies of existing Endings projects and how they got finished (Graves’ Diary;
Mariage)
- Claire presents “Mistakes Were Made”
DAY 2. Challenges of Digital Preservation
Morning: Data

Data preservation (Lisa)
Introduce Data Management Tool
Data Management Plan
Afternoon: Platform and Tools

Challenges of digital dependencies (Stewart)
Project interface as material object (Matt)
Exercise: Enumerate the dependencies of your project
Exercise: Assess robustness and longevity of tools
Exercise: List the issues from your Archive-It run-through that need to be addressed
DAY 3. Your Endings-Compliant Completion Plan
Morning

Resources: How many person-hours do you have? (Janelle)
Itemizing, prioritizing, costing, and drawing a line under your completion tasks (Janelle and Ewa)
People problems (scope creep): resisting the urge to do more or start something new
Diagnostics to measure your progress (Martin and Joey)
Afternoon: Hackathon to write (or implement) your diagnostics
(All programmers on deck.)

DAY 4. Preparing the Archivable Edition for Deposit
Morning

What does your library want? What will they grudgingly accept? (Lisa, John, Matt)
Practical steps to “staticize” various types of site (Martin, Stewart, Greg)
Validation and standards compliance (Martin)
Afternoon
Best practices for design (layout, tools, interface) (Guest: Pat Szpak)
Advice (e.g., “be of your time”; “it’s okay for it to look old-fashioned; it’s not okay for it to
stop working”)
Critical questions about interface (Janelle)
DAY 5.
Documentation (Janelle)
Who’s it for? What types of documentation?
Exercise: Hand your project to someone else (A to B, B to C, ... n to A). B pretends to be a
librarian archiving the project and answers questions on a form we provide (e.g., “What type
of data is in this project?” “What software dependencies does it have?” “Who did what
when?” “What are the licensing terms?” etc .)
Course wrap-up (Martin and Janelle)
