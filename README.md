## Concluding, Archiving, and Preserving Digital Projects for Long-Term Usability

Despite the thousands of digital projects launched during the past 20 years, experts warn of a new
"digital dark age" as our ability to produce digital information continues to outpace our capacity to
preserve and access that knowledge for the long haul.

These problems are particularly acute in the digital humanities (DH). In Canada alone, SSHRC has
invested $15.8 million on 138 projects through its ITST program. The challenge of preserving and
future-proofing these projects---many based on boutique technologies and customized
code---jeopardizes the return on this public investment. To continue to reap the benefits of these
projects, we must invest in workable processes and technologies so we can collect, preserve and provide
user-friendly access for longer than the estimated 10-year lifespan of most current formats.
While a growing body of research on the closure and preservation of digital projects identifies the
urgency and scale of these challenges, few feasible solutions have been offered.

The University of Victoria's extensive experience with a broad variety of SSHRC and CFI-funded
DH projects over the past 15 years gives our team a unique perspective to consider these questions.
Each of our funded DH projects has well-developed scholarly content useful to the scholarly community
for the foreseeable future, and each poses different, representative problems for sustained digital
conservation and usability. Our multidisciplinary team, including research faculty from several
disciplines, programmers, and a digital librarian, has collective theoretical and practical experience in
geohumanities, multimedia markup, endangered language documentation, textual editing, digital
publishing, and text encoding.

Using case studies that address the following research questions, we plan to develop practical
strategies for concluding and preserving scholarly digital projects, and for maintaining long-term
usability across a representative range of disciplines and DH methodologies.
How do and how should DH projects conclude? In the nonlinear, ever-expanding environment of digital
technologies, even when the project endpoint has been planned from its inception, finishing is itself
problematic. The dynamic nature of digital data lends itself to new and promising possibilities, and the
protean digital environment makes publication a moving target. Despite these temptations, while our
research and scholarship go on, projects---even digital ones---need to end. We will survey the
ITST-funded projects and propose concrete conclusion strategies.
How should we preserve projects to retain their dynamic features? By extrapolating from existing
theoretical models and experimenting with our own projects, we will develop exemplary programming
strategies to maintain site usability, readability, and tools. Our toolkits, available on a website to be
widely shared with the DH community, will contain background (white) papers, checklists, advice, and
best practices for the closure and preservation of projects, focusing on practical, scalable solutions.
Where should projects be archived? While university libraries are reliable repositories for static digital
material, we need multiple repositories that can preserve the dynamic features of projects. However,
such distributed archiving will also magnify the technological, economic, and political challenges of
preservation identified in the literature. Our toolkit will therefore address intellectual property concerns
along with maintenance strategies, long-term stability, and access issues. We will consider the needs of
various stakeholders and potential repositories, including universities, memory institutions, non-profits,
and national and international governments.
