# Ending Your Digital Humanities Project from the Start
 
Departing from the oft-asked question of “How do I know when my project is finished?”, this presentation centers around the question “How do I end my digital project, even if I don’t think it’s *done*?” Though various criteria have been proposed for evaluating the “done-ness” of a project (see, for example, [Digital Humanities Quarterly 2009 cluster “Done”](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/2/index.html)), there has been little discussion about how to ensure that your project is archivable, accessible, and stable even if the project’s primary objects—say, an edition of a text—do not completely meet your project’s definition of “done.” 

The Endings project, based out of the University of Victoria, is a collaborative project between digital humanities programmers, project directors, and university librarians that focuses less on  content-based “done-ness” and more on best practices for archivable and sustainable scholarship. While the digital projects that form the core of the Endings project—[*The Robert Graves Diary*](http://graves.uvic.ca), [*Le Mariage Sous L’Ancien Régime*](http://mariage.uvic.ca), *The Nxaʔamxcín Dictionary Project*, and [*The Map of Early Modern London*](http://mapoflondon.uvic.ca)—are all at varying stages of completion, they share a common set of principles that lead to maximum archivability and accessibility. In this presentation, I discuss two of these projects at either end of the completion spectrum: *The Robert Graves Diary*, which was technically finished in the mid-2000s but required significant upgrades throughout the last decade; and The Map of Early Modern London, a long-standing project whose many objectives include a complete set of the extant mayoral pageants of London from 1585 to 1639 by 2022. Through these projects, I explore what makes a project “Endings-compliant” and offer up some best principles for thinking about how to end your digital humanities project from the start.
